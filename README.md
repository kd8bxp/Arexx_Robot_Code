# Archived Aug 20, 2024 

I no longer own these robots.  The code should be able to be adapted for other two wheel robots. But I will not be updating here. The code is being left for history. And I have already added other code for these robots a few days ago (That code some how never got into the repository in the first place). This repository is 4 years old and really hasn't been updated since then. There for it is time to archive and move to other/new projects. 

# Arexx Robot Code

A repository for information, code, pdfs, and more for the Arexx Robots I own.  
Some of this maybe from Arexx, a lot of this is stuff I've created, some of it maybe stuff other people have created.  

Some of it works, some of it doesn't work, some of it is test code, some of isn't - it is really pretty much a mess of different things.  

## Libraries

Because the Arduino IDE has been getting pretty bad handling libraries, I've included the libraries used in the src directory of the sketch. These libraries may have been slightly modified to work from the sketch directory, and do not include the examples.
